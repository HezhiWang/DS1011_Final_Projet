# DS1011_Final_Projet


# DIIN_PyTorch

  We followed the idea from: : https://github.com/YichenGong/Densely-Interactive-Inference-Network and reimplemented the code in Pytorch.

  To implement our code, you can follow the instructions from: https://github.com/YichenGong/Densely-Interactive-Inference-Network to set up environment and download data.

# Environment:
``python = 3.6``
``pytorch = 0.2.0_4``

# To run the code: 
 
`` cd DIIN/DIIN_PyTorch/pytorch/trian_snli_pytorch.py``
``python train_mnli_pytorch.py DIIN_pytorch demo_testing_SNLI --training_completely_on_snli``
