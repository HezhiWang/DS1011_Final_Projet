# DIIN_PyTorch

  We followed the idea of DIIN and implemented the code from in Pytorch: https://github.com/YichenGong/Densely-Interactive-Inference-Network

  To implement our code, you can follow the instructions from: https://github.com/YichenGong/Densely-Interactive-Inference-Network to set up environment and download data.

# Environment:
``python = 3.6``
``pytorch = 0.2.0_4``

# To run the code: 
 
`` cd DIIN/DIIN_PyTorch/pytorch/trian_snli_pytorch.py``
``python train_mnli_pytorch.py DIIN_pytorch demo_testing_SNLI --training_completely_on_snli --debug_model ``
